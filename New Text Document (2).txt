Problem Statement

You are given an array 'A' consisting of 'N' positive integers.

You can perform the following operation any number of times:

Choose any index 'i' such that 1 <= 'i'<= 'N' and select any integer 'X' such that '1 <= X<

A[i]', change 'A[i]' to 'A[i] xor X'.

Find the maximum possible AND of the whole array 'A'.

Note: AND of the array is 'A[1]) & A[2] & A[3] &... & A[N]'.

Example:

'N' = 3

'A' [3, 5, 4]

We do the following operations:

Change 'A[2]' to 'A[2] xor 2 = 7'.
Change 'A[3]' to 'A[3] xor 3 = 7'.

The AND of the new array is '3 & 7 & 7 = 3'. 
It can be shown that this is the maximum possible AND.



Hint:
The operation can activate all bits less than an element's MSB (Most
Significant Bit). Use the element with the smallest MSB to determine the
answer.


Input Format:
The first line contains an integer 'T', which denotes the number of test
cases to be run. Then the test cases follow.

The first line of every test case contains an integer 'N' ,
denoting the length of the array.

each test case's second line contains 'N' space-separated elements of an array 'A'


Output Format:
For each test case, return the maximum possible AND of the array.
Constraints:

1 <= T <= 10

1 <= N <= 10^5

1 <= A[i] <= 10^6

Time Limit: 1 sec
